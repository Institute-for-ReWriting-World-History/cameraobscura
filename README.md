## What is LANGUAGE?

>**lan’guage** (lăn'gwốj), *n.* \[ME.  *langage*, F. *langage*, fr.
>L. *lingua* the tongue, hence speech, language; akin to E. *tongue*.
>See <u>Tongue</u>, cf. <u>Lingual</u>.\]
>
>1.  The body of words and methods of combining words used and understood
>    by a considerable community, esp. when fixed and elaborated by long
>    usage; a tongue; as, the Latin *language*.
>
>    Wherever a *language* is alive, it grows. *Lowell.*
>
>2.  Any means of expressing or communicating feeling or thought. In the
>    usual sense, *language* means a system of conventionalized signs;
>    that is, words or gestures having fixed meanings. But not all
>    intelligible expressions are fixed, nor are all used exclusively for
>    communication, since language plays a large rôle in our thinking
>    processes. Hence *language* may mean (1) expression that conveys
>    ideas, (2) expression that symbolizes ideas. Bodily expression,
>    whether gesture or articulation, and inscription, as printing,
>    writing, etc., are its chief forms, but any systematic symbolism, in
>    a more or less transferred sense, is called *laignage;* as, the
>    *language* of art.
>
>    Identical reference or rational convention is thus the root and 
>    essence of the system of signs which we call *language*. *B Bosanquet*.
>
>   *Language* is the depository of the accumulated body of experience to
>    which all former ages have contributed their part, and which is the
>    inheritance of all yet to come. *J.S. Mill.*
>
>3.  Specif. : **a** The faculty of verbal expression and the use of
>    words in human intercourse, or the words themselves in their
>    grammatical relationships as given or preserved in literary
>    embodiments. See AGGLUTINATIVE LANGUAGES, INFLECTIONAL LANGUAGES,
>    ISOLATING LANGUAGES.
>
>     We infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the
>     *language*, which is a sort of monument to which each forcible
>     individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone. *Emerson*
>
>     **b** The inarticulate sounds by which animals inferior to man express their feelings or their wants.
>
>4.  The power, use, or manner of use of expression, esp. verbal
>    expression; specif.: **a** Form or manner of expression;
>    characteristic mode of arranging words, peculiar to an individual
>    speaker or writer; style.
>
>    Others for *language* all their care express. *Pope*
>    **b**. The vocabulary and phraseology belonging to an art or
>    department of knowledge; as, medical *language*; the *language* of
>    chemistry or theology. understand foreign languages. c Ability to
>    speak or d The suggestion, by objects, actions, or conditions, of
>   ideas associated therewith; as, the *language* of flowers.
>
>   There was…*language* in their very gesture. *Shak*.
>
>5.  Talk; speaking; esp., censure; abuse. *Obs.*
>
>6.  A race, as distinguished by its speech. *Rare.*
>
>All the people, the nations, and the *languages*, fell down and
>worshipped the golden image. *Dan. iii. 7.*
>
>7.  A national division of an international order; as, the *language* of
>    Aragon of the Hospitalers.
>
> Syn. — LANGUAGE, SPEECH are often interchangeable. But SPEECH retains
> more explicitly than *language* the fundamental suggestion of
> articulate or vocal utterance: LANGUAGE has acquired a more
> generalized application: as. "The *language* of the age is never the
> *language* of poetry” (*T. Gray*); “ Thou art a Galilean, and thy
> speech agreeth thereto (*MK. xiv. 70*). See DICTION, CANT (Webster
> 1211).


## What is NOT?

>**not** (not), adv. \[ME. *not, noht, nought*, the same word as E.
>*naught*. See NOUGHT, NAUGHT.\] An adverbial particle expressing
>negation; —corresponding to the attributive *no.* As used with verbs,
>not immediately after or before a simple tense or form of an ordinary
>verb is now archaic and chiefly poetic; as, "that which satisfieth
>not;" "all that not harms distinctive womanhood." It is used commonly
>either with an auxiliary verb or with the substantive verb *be*, in
>both cases immediately following; as, “Thou shalt *not* steal.” When
>used with an infinitive or verbal noun in -*ing,not* precedes.
>
>*Not* one word spoke he more than was need. *Chaucer.*
>
>Thine eyes are upon me, and I am *not. Job* vii. 8.
>
>May I do it, or may I *not* do it? *Bp. Sanderson.*
>
>not but, only. Cf. NOBBUT. *Obs.* n. guilty, *Law*, the words of
>general issue, used to deny the whole declaration or indictment, in
>various actions, as of tresspass, trover, and criminal cases. — n.
>out. See CRICKET, game.—n. proved, or *now more commonly,* not proven,
>*Scots Law,* the verdict brought in by a jury who find that the
>charges made are not proved. It operates as an acquittal, in the same
>way as a verdict of *not guilty.* It has been erroneously explained as
>being a verdict casting suspicion upon the accused not operating as a
>bar to further prosecution (Webster 1471).


## LATINUM  

Excerpt From *DE LINGUA LATINA*, Book V: On the Science of the Origin of Words, Addressed to Cicero[^8]
<br>

<details>
<summary>
    By MARCUS TERENTIUS VARRO [Translation By Roland G. Kent]
</summary>


1.  In what way names were applied to things in Latin, I have undertaken
    to expound, in six books. Of these, I have already composed three
    before this one, and have addressed them to Septumius; in them I
    treat of the branch of learning which is called Etymology-. The
    considerations which might be raised against it, I have put in the
    first book; those adduced in its favour, in the second; those merely
    describing it, in the third. In the following books, addressed to
    you, I shall discuss the problem from what things names were applied
    in Latin, both those which are habitual with the ordinary folk,
    and those which are found in the poets.

2.  Inasmuch as each and every word has two innate features, from what
    thing and to what thing the name is applied (therefore, when the
    question is raised from what thing pertinacia 'obstinacy' is, it is
    shown to be from pertendere' to persist' : to what thing it is
    applied, is told when it is explained that it is pertinacia
    'obstinacy' in a matter in which there ought not to be persistence
    but there is, because it is perseverantia' steadfastness' if a
    person persists in that in which he ought to hold firm), that former
    part, where they examine why and whence words are, the Greeks call
    Etymology, that other part they call Semantics. Of these two matters
    I shall speak in the following books, not keeping them apart, but
    giving less attention to the second.

3.  These relations are often rather obscure for the following reasons:
    Not every word that has been applied, still exists, because lapse of
    time has blotted out some. Not every word that is in use, has been
    applied without inaccuracy of some kind, nor does every word which
    has been applied correctly remain as it originally was; for many
    words are disguised by change of the letters. There are some whose
    origin is not from native words of our own language. Many words
    indicate one thing now, but formerly meant something else, as is the
    case with hostis 'enemy' : for in olden times by this word they
    meant a foreigner from a country independent of Roman laws, but now
    they give the name to him whom they then called perduellis 'enemy.'

4.  I shall take as starting-point of my discussion that derivative or
    case-form of the words in which the origin can be more clearly seen.
    It is evident that we ought to operate in this way, because when we
    say inpos 'lacking power' in the nominative, it is less clear that
    it is from potentia 'power' than when wesay inpotem in the
    accusative ; and it becomes the more obscure, if you say pos ‘having
    power' rather than inpos; for pos seems to mean rather pons 'bridge'
    than potens ' powerful.'

5.  There are few things which lapse of time does not distort, there are
    many which it removes. Whom you saw beautiful as a boy, him you see
    unsightly in his old age. The third generation does not see a person
    such as the first generation saw him. Therefore those that oblivion
    has taken away even from our ancestors, the painstaking of Mucius
    and Brutus, though it has pursued the runaways, cannot bring back.
    As for me, even if I cannot track them down, I shall not be the
    slower for this, but even for this I shall be the swifter in the
    chase, if I can. For there is no slight darkness in the wood where
    these things are to be caught, and there are no trodden paths to the
    place which we wish to attain, nor do there fail to be obstacles in
    the paths, which could hold back the hunter on his way.

6.  Now he who has observed in how many ways the changing has taken
    place in those words, new and old, in which there is any and every
    manner of variation in popular usage, will find the examination of
    the origin of the words an easier task; for he will find that words
    have been changed, as I have shown in the preceding books,
    essentially on account of two sets of four causes. For the
    alterations come about by the loss or the addition of single letters
    and on account of the transposition or the change of them, and
    likewise by the lengthening or the shortening of syllables, and
    their addition or loss: since I have adequately shown by examples,
    in the preceding books, of what sort these phenomena are, I have
    thought that here 1 need only set a reminder of that previous
    discussion.
